# Machine Learning Projects Repository

Welcome to the **ML Projects Repository**!  
This repository is dedicated to all things Machine Learning (ML), including:

- **Machine Learning Projects:** End-to-end ML workflows, data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and deployment.
- **Deep Learning:** Projects using neural networks, CNNs, RNNs, and advanced architectures.
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP):** Text classification, sentiment analysis, language modeling, and more.
- **Theoretical Concepts:** Notes, explanations, and code snippets covering ML theory, algorithms, and best practices.

## Structure

- Each project is organized in its own folder or file.
- Theoretical concepts and notes are included for reference and learning.
